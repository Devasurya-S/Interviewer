The Web App has two modules employee and candidate. The employee can create and log in to their module which then provides functionalities such as adding or deleting candidates individually or in groups, creating interviews and set them to candidates, View answers send from candidates and give feedback messages back to them. All three functions have a dedicated panel for read, create, update and delete operations. 

The Candidates can log in to their module via credentials given by the employee. Attend the interview and submit answers as video if any and view feedback messages then logout.
